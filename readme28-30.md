# ðŸ“˜ Day 28
# Application Programming Interface(API)
## API
Application Programming Interface(API). The kind of API will cover in this section is going to be Web APIS.
Web APIs are the defined interfaces through which interactions happen between an enterprise and applications that use its assets, which also is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to specify the functional provider and expose the service path or URL for its API users.
In the context of web development, an API is defined as a set of specifications, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, usually in an XML or a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. 
Web API has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) towards more direct representational state transfer (REST) style web resources.
Social media services, web APIs have allowed web communities to share content and data between communities and different platforms. Using API, content that is created in one place dynamically can be posted and updated to multiple locations on the web.
For example, Twitter's REST API allows developers to access core Twitter data and the Search API provides methods for developers to interact with Twitter Search and trends data. Many applications provide API end points. An example [API](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all).
In this section, we will cove a RESTful API that uses HTTP request methods to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

## Building API
RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. In the previous sections, we have learned about python, flask and mongoDB. We will use the knowledge we acquire to develop a RESTful API using python flask and mongoDB. Every application which has CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation has an API to create data, to get data, to update data or to delete data from database.
